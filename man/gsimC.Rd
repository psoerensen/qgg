\title{Simulate Genetic Data Based on Given Parameters}
\usage{
gsimC(Glist = NULL, h2 = NULL, pi = NULL, pv = NULL, m = NULL, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Glist}{A list containing genetic data. If NULL, the function will stop with an error.}

\item{h2}{Heritability. If NULL, heritability of 0.5 is assumed.}

\item{pi}{Proportion of causal markers. The values for either `m` or `pi` should be provided at any given time.}

\item{pv}{Prevalence. A value between >0 and <1. If NULL then trait is continuous.}

\item{m}{Number of causal markers. The values for either `m` or `prp.cau` should be provided at any given time. 
If the list of quality controlled markers is not available then list of raw markers is used.  
If `m` is NULL and `pi` is also NULL, `pi` will default to 0.001.}

\item{n}{Number of individuals randomly sampled from `Glist`. If NULL, all the individuals on `Glist` is used.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{y}: Vector of simulated phenotypes.
  \item \code{g}: Vector of simulated genetic values.
  \item \code{e}: Vector of simulated residual effects.
  \item \code{b}: Vector of effect sizes of the simulated causal markers.
  \item \code{causal}: Vector of ids for the simulated causal markers.
  \item \code{h2}: Estimated heritability of the simulated phenotype.
}
}
\description{
This function simulates phenotype data by random sampling of markers available on `Glist`.
Default parameters for the simulated phenotype reflect the genetic architecture assumed by BayesC prior(Habier et al., 2011).
This function is under active development.
