\description{
Quality control is a critical step for working with summary statistics (in particular
                                                                        for external). 
Processing and quality control of GWAS summary statistics includes:                                                                      

- map marker ids (rsids/cpra (chr, pos, ref, alt)) to LD reference panel data 
- check effect allele (flip EA, EAF, Effect)
- check effect allele frequency
- thresholds for MAF and HWE
- exclude INDELS, CG/AT and MHC region
- remove duplicated marker ids
- check which build version
- check for concordance between marker effect and LD data

External summary statistics format:
 marker, chr, pos, effect_allele, non_effect_allele, effect_allele_freq, effect, effect_se, stat, p, n    

Internal summary statistics format:
 rsids, chr, pos, a1, a2, af, b, seb, stat, p, n
