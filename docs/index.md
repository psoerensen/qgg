This tutorial provide a simple introduction to polygenic risk scoring (PRS) of complex
traits and diseases using simulated data. The practical will be a mix of theoretical and practical exercises in R that are used for
illustrating/applying the theory presented in the corresponding lecture notes on polygenic risk scoring.

In this tutorial we will be analysing quantitative traits observed in a mice population. The mouse data
consist of phenotypes for traits related to growth and obesity (e.g. body weight, glucose levels in blood),
pedigree information, and genetic marker data.
